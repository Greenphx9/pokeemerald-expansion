# iridescent-red
Yes... this is another branch, making the total 3. But this time Im fully planning out my game, and I plan to keep track off everything. Anyways:

Pokemon Iridescent Red is a WIP ROM hack. While it is based off the emerald expansion, it'll still be set in Kanto. I plan to fully remake Kanto, being mostly based off HGSS, while containing most, if not all Pokemon available.
