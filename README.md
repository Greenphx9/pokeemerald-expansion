# Pokemon Inflamed Red

Pokemon Inflamed Red is a modern Kanto-based hack. Inflamed Red is based of [pokeemerald-expansion](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion). Credits & huge thanks to everyone who has contributed to it!\

## Features
Inflamed Red is still very WIP. While these features are planned, they may not be implemented yet.
### Difficulty
Inflamed Red was designed for people who have dabbled a bit in competitive Pokemon, but are not super experienced. Inflamed Red also has a casual difficulty, and hard difficulty, so everyone can enjoy.

### Rebalanced Pokemon
Most Pokemon have been rebalanced, so you can use your favourites even if they are not competitively viable!

### Gen 9 Pokemon, Items, Abilities, Mechanics, etc
These are from [pokeemerald-expansion](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion).

### Catch 'em all
Every Pokemon will be available by the time the game is beaten, allowing any of the over 1000 Pokemon available to use.

### Expanded Story
I'm sure most people reading this have already played a Kanto hack, and the story would've got boring by now. In Inflamed Red, the story will be modified, so while it still is based in Kanto and resolves are Team Rocket, different events will happen, and you will encounter new friends & foes. 

### Side Quests
Additional side quests are available, with rewards ranging from exclusive Pokemon to exclusive mechanics.

### Expanded post-game
Normally, aside from the Sevii Islands, Fire Red has nothing to do after the Elite Four is finished. In Inflamed Red, the Sevii Island's story will be expanded on, and a battle frontier will be present.





> Hang on poke**emerald**-expansion? I thought this was a Kanto-based hack?

While the base of this hack is Pokemon Emerald, the whole of Kanto, and many Fire-Red/Leaf-Green exclusive features have been ported over, allowing me to use the pokeemerald-expansion project in a Kanto hack.
