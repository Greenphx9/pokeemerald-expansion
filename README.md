## Tera Raids

This is my implementation of Tera Raids in pokeemerald-expansion. Huge credits to both Skeli's Complete-Fire-Red-Upgrade & AgustinGDLV partially complete raids feature branch as code & graphics has been used from both. These Tera Raids ARE not meant to be 1:1 but are instead customized to my liking & for my hack, for example the time limit has been replaced with a turn limit & the battle turn order has not been changed.
