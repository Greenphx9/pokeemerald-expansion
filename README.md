# Iridescent Red
Pokemon Iridescent Red is an upcoming Pokemon ROM hack that is set in a modernized Kanto. The main point of this hack is to be a difficulty hack, but it will also contain a remastered story and expanded post game. Additionally, each and every Pokemon in the game will be available in one way or another.

## Additional branches
I am isolating some key features of my hack to their standalone branches for users to use.
- [ir/gen3-tiles](https://github.com/Greenphx9/pokeemerald-expansion/tree/ir/gen3-tiles): Modernized Kanto tiles for Emerald, including sideways stairs, lit up windows, etc.
- [ir/battle-bg](https://github.com/Greenphx9/pokeemerald-expansion/tree/ir/battle-bg): Platinum battle backgrounds + 6 colour background system
