# custom-icons-pal
This is a fork of [aarant's icons branch](https://github.com/aarant/pokeemerald/tree/icons) that has been modified to use custom palettes for icons rather than the battle sprite palettes. I aim to port every icon from Gen 1-7 from [pokesprite](https://msikma.github.io/pokesprite/overview/dex-gen7.html) and other generations from other references.
