# Pokemon Gen 4 text boxes

Here are my ports of the Gen 4 text boxes to GBA. The sprites are taken from [spriters-resource.com](https://spriters-resource.com) and reworked for GBA.

You are free to use them in your hack, just credit me. You may need to [make changes](https://github.com/Greenphx9/pokeemerald-expansion/blob/inflamed-red/src/menu.c#L90) to the field message window template, and you will need to [make changes](https://github.com/Greenphx9/pokeemerald-expansion/blob/inflamed-red/src/menu.c#L294) to the function that handles drawing.
